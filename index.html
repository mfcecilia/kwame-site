        <h1>About Us</h1>
        
        <p>Have you thought of trying out new experiences in other parts of the globe? That thought drove me to look for employment overseas. This file is a resource that can help many people who are interested in overseas employment. I have worked overseas for the past 5 years and I understand the difficulties in researching for opportunities in other countries when you are not sure where to begin. </p>
        
        <h3>How it Works</h3>
        
        <p>We have a list of contact information for a variety of recruiters. You can choose to purchase all these contacts, or you can filter out contacts based on your preferences. Filtering out a certain number of contacts will result in a lower price.</p>

        <p>This is to provide the resource for contacting recruiters for overseas employment. It is not a guarantee that the position you are looking for can be found, but with the many contacts on this list, the odds are more favorable. The site helps provide access to resources quicker than if this list of contacts was not purchased. The contacts are recruiters from major companies that do work overseas and may have stateside opportunities as well. This means that the potential for jobs are not limited to those overseas. However, this also means that it does not guarantee it will have every overseas location you'd like.</p>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        
        <h3>Have these resources led to people finding employment?</h3>
        
            <p>Yes I have referred friends and colleagues of mine to some of the contacts and they were hired in a matter of weeks.
            </p>
        
        <h3>How can I guarantee the kind of job opportunity I want is available in the list?</h3>
        
            <p>There is not a way to guarantee that the kind of job you are looking for will be attained via the recruiter list. We only provide you with an opportunity to talk to someone directly for quicker results. 
            </p>
        <!--  
        <h3>Why include two filters based on the company and/or the amount of contacts a company has?</h3>
        
            <p>For some people, being able to increase the odds of getting hired sooner is much more important to them than the company itself. That is why we let you search based on the amount of contacts. There are also people who wish to increase their odds of getting a job at their dream company. This is why we include an alphabetical filter option. You don't lose time filtering through other companies. Helping people save time is part of our mission. Lastly, allowing people to filter out contacts (instead of buying the full list) at a lower price is important for those on a tight budget.
