        <p>Have you thought of trying out new experiences in other parts of the globe? That thought drove me to look for employment overseas. This file is a resource that can help many people who are interested in overseas employment. I have worked overseas for the past 5 years and I understand the difficulties in researching for opportunities in other countries when you are not sure where to begin. </p>
        
        <h3>How it Works</h3>
        
        <p>We have a list of contact information for a variety of recruiters. You can choose to purchase all these contacts, or you can filter out contacts based on your preferences. Filtering out a certain number of contacts will result in a lower price.</p>

        <p>This is to provide the resource for contacting recruiters for overseas employment. It is not a guarantee that the position you are looking for can be found, but with the many contacts on this list the odds are more favorable. The site helps provide access to resources quicker than if this list of contacts wasn't purchased. The contacts are recruiters from major companies that do work overseas and may have stateside opportunity as well. This means that the potential for jobs aren't limited to those overseas. However, this also means that it doesn't guarantee it will have every overseas location you'd like.</p>
